### Not About Me ðŸ¤”

This is not about me but about what I want to be. As Generative AI can just search but not advice. So I need some real human who can give some really good career & wrok advice.

I've 14+ years experience in IT. And I'm bored!! I created many open source applications. Some of them got a good recognition like [fast-xml-parser](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/) but I still feel I'm lacking of real innovation. I introduced [bigbit](https://github.com/amitguptagwl/BigBit), and [nimnjs](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/nimnjs) (those I really like) but couldn't spend much time to make them impact full technologies yet as I was diverted to overcome on financial need first. 

My all the solutions are influenced by accessibility, speed, automation, less memory utilization, less decisions, and generic implementation. What fetch my attention are: Creativity & Designs, Nature, Space, Gadgets, logics, algorithms, strategical thinking etc. I like to explore new things or concept and improve them. I'm not a fast learner. Instead, when I learn something, I dive into deep imagination, visualize it, relate with real life concepts, find the real usecases, ask so many "WHY", and make a better solution if possible.  I love teaching complex concepts to kids in fun and interactive ways. This satisfies me most.  

An idea about ideas floating in my head currently 
- get rid of mouse or touchpad (many advantages)
- improving security in Linux
- enhanced data compression from server to client
- Enhanced note taking application by including searchable video and audios and many other components
- Children safe dynamic videos
- Automation friendly browser to reduce automation test time.
- documentation derived coding to reduce effort of maintaining documents after code change. 
- labelled logging to reduce log size and speed up log processing
- completing a project to teach a 8+ year old kid everything about cloud computing in just few hours. 
- Completing Fast XML Parser v5, next version of Stubmatic
- Native support to a programming language to support BigBit data type and data encoding.
- ....

Though I'm learning cloud currently, but this is just for career need not for my interest. Sometimes I think to take a break and improve my core areas, work on each idea my own and then wait for the recognition. But it is the most risky path financially and time wise. The other thought can be a part-time job to balance on finance, family and my interests. But it also not easy to find. 

Your guidance can help me to reduce my anxiety and wastage of time.
