I've published many open-source projects like [Fast-Xml-Parser](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/),  [ImgLab](https://solothought.com/imglab), [Stubmatic](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/Stubmatic) etc. These are some users of my work;

I want to dedicate my full time in research and art. I keep publishing my thoughts on [Solothought](https://solothought.com/). I want to make learning fun and keep my all work free if possible. 

# Career Aspiration
I'm always open for any art or research work. I can learn anything of any field that fits to my interest. Everything catches my attention, from creative art and DIY projects to nature, recycling, solving everyday problems, robotics, cosmology, fun learning activities, and algorithms. I'm not interested in just configuration, management, or documentation.
