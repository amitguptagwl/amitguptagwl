I'm glad that you find the way to reach to this page. But you probably don't know many more things. So let me brief;

I've published many open-source projects. Some of them are

| Package | Stats | Summary|
| -- |-- |-- |
|[Fast-Xml-Parser](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/)| 64800000+ downloads/month |Parse Xml to ANY. Build to XML back |
|[ImgLab](https://solothought.com/imglab)| 6000+ users per month | Annotate images for ML in browser |
|[Stubmatic](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/Stubmatic)| 2500+ downloads/month | HTTP Mocking Server |
|[Nimn js](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/nimn-spec) | 200000+ downloads/month | Compressed data format
|[Strnum](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strnum)|42000000+ downloads/month| Parse String to Number|

These are some projects and companies which use my work

I want to keep my work free and open-source. But it is challenging. Maintaining many projects need a lot of time and the motivation from the users.

I stopped updating Stubmatic, and Nimn js long back because I was not sure if it is being used on enterprise level or people really need them. But few days back when I noticed that [Nimn js](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/nimn-spec) is slowing reaching to achieve 100 github stars and there are 200000+ downloads/month, I'm confused if I should work on it's next version. So please star the project you like or let me know if your organization is using it so that I can prioritize the project for next development.

Here are my some projects that I really like but you probably are not aware

| Package | Summary|
| -- |-- |
| [BigBit](https://github.com/amitguptagwl/bigBit/)|Improved Numeric data type and text-encoding|
| [Anumargak](https://github.com/node-muneem/anumargak)|Router for node js based frameworks|
